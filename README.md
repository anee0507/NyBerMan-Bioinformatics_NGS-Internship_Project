# NyBerMan Bioinformatics_NGS Internship_Project

This is a mini project during the remote internship at NyBerMan Bioinformatics (2024) on NGS and WGS. 

The Bioproject: PRJEB62494 represent a whole genome sequencing of tongue cancer samples and cell line performed to identify the fusion gene translocation breakpoint. 

We used  3 SRA Accessions: ERR11468775, ERR11468776 and 
ERR11468777 as a sample1, sample 2 and sample 3 accordingly with 2
Chromosomes of 20, 21. 

Our objective is to identify common and unique variants for each sample because in genomic variants distinguishing  which mismatches represent real mutations and which are noises is challenging.

We develop a pipeline for variant calling and perform annotation for this project.
